# CHAPTER # 3 FUNCTION

Task 1:
Write a function that can take 3 ​ integer​ numbers as
argument/parameter and ​ prints​ the sum of them 

Task 2:

# CHAPTER # 3 CONTROL FLOW

TASK#1
Store marks in a variable and print the Grade of student.
Marks Range:
Greater than 80 - Grade A+
Between 70 and 80 - Grade A
Between 60 and 70 - Grade B
Between 50 and 60 - Grade C
Between 40 and 50 - Grade D
Below 40 - Grade F
Hint [ condition 1 &&  condition 2 ]

TASK#2
Print even numbers using for loop. (till 20)
Output: 2,4,6,8,10,12,....

TASK#3
Print odd numbers using while loop. (till 19)
Output: 1,3,5,7,9,11

TASK#4
Store an integer (any value) in a variable and ​ print the table of that number using any loop. (till  * 12)

Output:
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
5 * 4 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
5 * 6 = 30
5 * 7 = 35
5 * 8 = 40
5 * 9 = 45
5 * 10 = 50

# CHAPTER # 4 OWNERSHIP

Task#1

Assign a variable s to PAKISTAN then make a function that takes s variable as parameter/argument but doesn’t take ownership of s variable and concatenates “ZINDABAD” in variable s to makes it “PAKISTAN ZINDABAD”. Print variable s after change

Task#2

Take a string input from user and store it in a variable then pass that variable in a function which returns you the length of the string. Print the length.
Hint:
Use std::io;
let mut x = String::new();
io::stdin.read_line(&mut x).expect(“invalid input”);
